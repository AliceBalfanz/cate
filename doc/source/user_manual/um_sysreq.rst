System Requirements
===================

Hardware
========

It is recommended to use an up-to-date computer, with at least 8GB of RAM and a multi-core CPU.
The most important bottlenecks will first be the data transfer rate from local data caches into the
executing program, so it is advised to use fast solid state disks. Secondly, the internet connection
speed matters, because the CCI Toolbox will frequently have to download data from remote services
in order to cache it locally.

Operating Systems
=================

The CCI Toolbox is supposed to work on up-to-date Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems.
