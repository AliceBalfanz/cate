CCI Toolbox Desktop
===================

The CCI Toolbox Desktop is a desktop application and will be the primary graphical user interface (GUI)
of the CCI Toolbox. As the phrasing *will be* implies, the GUI has not yet been developed.

However, the team created a demonstration prototype within a feasibility study conducted in the early stage of the
project. The following :numref:`demo_gui_1` and :numref:`demo_gui_2` are screenshots of the CCI Toolbox Desktop
demonstration prototype. The envisaged GUI may look similar later:

.. figure:: _static/figures/demo_gui_1.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   CCI Toolbox Desktop Demo #1

.. _demo_gui_2:

.. figure:: _static/figures/demo_gui_2.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center

   CCI Toolbox Desktop Demo #2

The source code of the demonstration prototype is hosted the public `demo <https://github.com/CCI-Tools/demo>`_
repository.
