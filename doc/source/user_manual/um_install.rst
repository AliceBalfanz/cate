============
Installation
============

Installers for the Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platform can be downloaded from the project's
`release page <https://github.com/CCI-Tools/ect-core/releases>`_ on GitHub.

The installers are self-contained, so there is no need to install additional software to run the
CCI Toolbox.

If you are a developer you may wish to build and install the CCI Toolbox from Python sources.
In this case, please follow the instructions given in the project's
`README <https://github.com/CCI-Tools/ect-core/blob/master/README.md>`_ on GitHub.
