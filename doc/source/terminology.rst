Terminology
===========

In order to avoid confusion and ambiguity, a common terminology was agreed on as listed in :numref:`terminologytab`. It is partially based on `[RD-9]`_ and `[RD-10]`_ and is to be used in all parts of the CCI Toolbox project from the user-sided activities to the software development. The concept regarding the naming of data is also illustrated in :numref:`terminology`.

   * - Term
     - CCI Toolbox Definition
   * - ECV
     - Umbrella term for geophysical quantity/quantities associated with climate variation and change as well as the impact of climate change onto Earth (e.g. cloud properties).
   * - ECV product
     - Subdivision of ECVs in long-term data record of values or fields, covering one or more geophysical quantities (e.g. Cloud Water Path).
   * - Geophysical quantity
     - One physical parameter/variable in that constitutes a time series of observations (e.g. Cloud Liquid Water Path).
   * - Dataset
     - In-memory representation of data read from a data source. Contains multiple layers of a geophysical quantity or multiple geophysical quantities with multiple layers encompassing e.g. information on temporal and spatial dimensions and localization or uncertainty information.
   * - Data product
     - Combination of dataset and geophysical quantity incl. uncertainty information (e.g. Cloud Liquid Water Path from L3S Modis merged phase1 v1.0 including uncertainty, standard deviation, number of observations, â€¦)
   * - Schema
     - Describes a dataset's structure, contents and data types.
   * - Data store
     - Offers multiple data sources.
   * - Data source
     - A concrete source for datasets. Has a schema and knows about dataset coverage. Used to load datasets.
