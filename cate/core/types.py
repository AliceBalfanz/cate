Description
===========

Implementation of custom complex types and appropriate value validation and conversion routines.

For example::

@op
@op_input('file', data_type=PathLike)
def some_op(name1: PathLike.TYPE) -> bool:
    # Do something useful
    pass

"""

    Base class for complex types which can convert a value of varying source types into a target type *T*.
    The varying source types are therefore *like* the target type *T*.
    """

    #: A type that represents the varying source types. This is usually a ``typing.Union`` instance which
    #: combines the varying source types.

    def accepts(cls, value: Any) -> bool:

            return False

    @abstractclassmethod
    def convert(cls, value: Any) -> T:
        """
        Convert the given source value (of type ``Like.TYPE``) into an instance of type *T*.
        @:raises ValueError if the conversion fails.
